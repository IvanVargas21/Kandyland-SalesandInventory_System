# Sales and Inventory System for Kandyland

## Project Overview

This Sales and Inventory System was developed for **Kandyland**, a small business in the Philippines, as a requirement for the subject **System Analysis and Design**. The base project was premade from the CodeAstor YouTube channel (developed by Siamon Hasan), and I customized it by adding specific functions and features required by the store. The system is a web-based application designed to help the store manage its inventory, track sales, and generate basic reports.

## Features
- **Product Management**: Add, update, and delete product details (name, price, stock quantity).
- **Inventory Tracking**: View available stock, set low-stock alerts, and monitor product status.
- **Sales Management**: Record sales transactions, including product details and quantities sold.
- **Reporting**: Generate daily, weekly, or monthly sales reports.
- **User Management**: Role-based access for admins and employees.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Elements**: PHP is used to construct the dynamic HTML elements, handling both the logic and display of content. CSS is applied for styling, and JavaScript is used for interactivity (e.g., modals and buttons).
- **Backend**: PHP for server-side processing and logic.
- **Database**: MySQL, managed via phpMyAdmin, for storing data such as products, categories, and user information.
- **Server**: XAMPP (Apache) for hosting the web application locally.
